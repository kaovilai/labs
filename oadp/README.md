# OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Lab

This guide will provide you with hands-on exposure to the new OpenShift API for Data Protection through a series of labs backup and restore workloads (both stateful and stateless) on the same OpenShift cluster.

## Description

Backup and restore stateless and stateful application workloads. This application is available for installation through the Operator Hub/OLM. This course requires OCP4 services from [RHPDS](http://rhpds.redhat.com/).

## Goals

* Backup and restore applications on OpenShift 4 clusters using the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP)) provided by OpenShift
Container Platform 4 leveraging both the UI and API.

* Tips, techniques, and best-practices for debugging failed backups/restores.

## Setup Steps
### Option 1: RHPDS OADP 

Step 1: Browse to RHPDS: https://rhpds.redhat.com

Step 3: Hover over Services Menu >> Click the Catalogs menu and open the “Openshift Workshop” catalog.

Step 4: Order **APIs For Data Protection (OADP)**

Step 5: Wait for services to become available.  ```This will take ~60 min.```. When the environment has finished provisioning you will receive an email with confirmation and access details for the labs.

Step 6. Proceed with Lab by following steps outlined in bookbag documentation.

### Option 2: Use any OpenShift 4.7-4.8 cluster that you have cluster-admin login with kubeadmin-password.
The cluster should not have existing `openshift-storage` and `openshift-adp` namespace

After `oc login` run the following and fill out any prompts for cluster-admin username and password.
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaovilai/labs/master/oadp/install-deploy.sh -o install-deploy.sh;
chmod +x ./install-deploy.sh
./install-deploy.sh
```

### Option 3: [OpenShift 4.9 Playground](https://developers.redhat.com/courses/explore-openshift/openshift-49-playground)
```sh
chmod +r /opt/kubeconfig
sudo podman run -it --env KUBECONFIG=/opt/kubeconfig -v /bin:/bin -v /opt/kubeconfig:/opt/kubeconfig:z -w /home python sh
```
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaovilai/labs/master/oadp/install-deploy.sh -o install-deploy.sh;
chmod +x ./install-deploy.sh
./install-deploy.sh
```
```sh
You are logged in to the OpenShift cluster.
1) kubeadmin
2) admin
3) OTHER
```
Select `2`

```sh
What is cluster admin password? example: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
```
type `admin`
